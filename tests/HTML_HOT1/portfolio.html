        <h2>TravelAgent</h2>
        <p>Im gonna be honest this project is crazy weird and I dont know what we were thinking at the time but this project is a travel planner were if you put the location you wanna go and when you are going it will find the cheapest flights, best places to stay, and good hotels. You do all this by talking to our travel agent who is an anime girl who is also voiced by me</p>

        <p>the github lets you run the project yourself and also has a readme which shows examples of the project</p>

        <h2>Bytefyte</h2>
        <p>Personal favorite project its very simple its a site where you 1v1 someone in leetcode. this site had some of my favorite technical challenges like how to use websockets and how to run a code editor in the browser.</p>
