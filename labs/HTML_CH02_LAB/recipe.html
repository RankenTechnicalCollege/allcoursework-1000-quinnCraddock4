    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>1 rotisserie-roasted chicken</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 cups milk</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup hot sauce (such as Frank's® Redhot®), or more to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup crumbled gorgonzola cheese</li>
      </ul>
      <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.</li>
        <li>Cook macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Cut wings and legs off rotisserie chicken. Remove skin and bones from wings and legs; chop or shred dark meat into bite-sized pieces.</li>

        <li>Pour in milk, whisking constantly, until thickened and bubbling, about 5 minutes. Continue to cook and stir until sauce is smooth, about 1 minute more. Reduce heat and season with pepper.</li>
        <li>Stir Cheddar and Monterey Jack into the sauce until melted and combined.</li>
        <li>Stir in hot sauce to the desired level of spiciness.</li>
        <li>Add Gorgonzola, chicken, and macaroni; mix well to combine.</li>
